Copy the kinectAssignment directory at your kinect/NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.21/Samples directory
(Because I have created the Makefile relative to this path)


To Compile
----------
>Open terminal, go to the folder "kinectAssignment" eg: cd kinectAssignment
>To compile type "make" and press enter
>ignore warnings, if any

To Run
------
> If it compiled without errors, then it must have created a folder "x86-Release" or "x64-Release" inside the folder kinectAssignment. Go to this folder and run following command
./kinectAssignment


You only need to edit DrawDepthMap function in SceneDrawer.cpp file

This function takes kinect depth map as input and does 2 major things
1. Remove noise (by only displaying pixels if number of pixels at a given depth is greater than a threshold, you have to guess a good value for threshold)
2. It will display pixels only if they are in a distance range(you need to set this distance value according to your game requirement).
