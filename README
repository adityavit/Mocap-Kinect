How to play this game?

In this game, you can find filled circles running across the screen and the user got to hover 
over one of the moving circles and move their hand towards the kinect, thus decreasing the 
depth value. This will expand the ball and after a paticular predefined threshold the circle
pops and you score a point!

------------
Copy the kinectAssignment directory at your kinect/NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.21/Samples directory

To Compile
----------
>Open terminal, go to the folder "kinectAssignment" eg: cd kinectAssignment
>To compile type "make" and press enter
>ignore warnings, if any

To Run
------
> If it compiled without errors, then it must have created a folder "x86-Release" or "x64-Release" inside the folder kinectAssignment. Go to this folder and run following command
./kinectAssignment


You only need to edit DrawDepthMap function in SceneDrawer.cpp file

This function takes kinect depth map as input and does 2 major things
1. Remove noise (by only displaying pixels if number of pixels at a given depth is greater than a threshold, you have to guess a good value for threshold)
2. It will display pixels only if they are in a distance range(you need to set this distance value according to your game requirement).
